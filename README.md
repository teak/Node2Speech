# Node2Speech
Simple command line exe to convert text to speech.

There is a compiled 64 bit exe for convenience.

Requires three or more command line arguments:

1. The output volume. Between 0 and 100.
2. The output speed. Between -10 and 10.
3. The text to speak. Any farther args are joined and spoken as well.

All other option for speech are set system wide, using the Control Panel.
